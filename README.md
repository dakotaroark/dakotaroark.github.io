# Churn Prediction

#### What is the current problem and our current solution to this problem?
Businesses are beginning to utilize machine learning to develop a better understanding of their customer base and 
this improved understanding will lead to more informed business decisions. One key indicator in business operations 
is our customer churn rate, with the ultimate goal to net more adds than those who churn. The current problem we 
have is that we are not leveraging our customer data to its full potential. We currently lack a viable method of 
predicting customer churn, which brings us to a possible solution, developing a churn prediction model. 

#### The Scope of the Machine Learning Model
* The goal of this model is to viably predict *postpaid* customer churn. 
   - Advance pay customer's lack key variables such as credit scores and credit class to accurately predict churn.
* The big picture goal of this project is an increased in business understanding
   - This understanding can better guide our retention efforts, pricing and credit classification.

#### The Data
* The data consisted of 122,616 rows from the January 2021 to August 2022.
* After cleaning the data, and filtering for postpaid customer, we were left with 65,244 rows.
   - Our overall churn rate was 15.66% over the 20 month period.
   - The average monthly recurring price was $44.90
