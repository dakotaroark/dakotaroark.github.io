# Churn Prediction

#### What is the current problem and our current solution to this problem?
Businesses are beginning to utilize machine learning to develop a better understanding of their customer base and 
this improved understanding will lead to more informed business decisions. One key indicator in business operations 
is our customer churn rate, with the ultimate goal to net more adds than those who churn. The current problem we 
have is that we are not leveraging our customer data to its full potential. We currently lack a viable method of 
predicting customer churn, which brings us to a possible solution, developing a churn prediction model. 

#### The scope of the Machine Learning Model
* The goal of this model is to viably predict *postpaid* customer churn.
